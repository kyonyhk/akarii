**Option A ‚Äî Social Media Blitz**  
Focus: Short-term buzz across Instagram, TikTok, and LinkedIn.  
Pros: Wide reach in days, great for awareness.  
Cons: High ad spend, limited depth in engagement.

**Option B ‚Äî Partner Webinars**  
Focus: Co-host educational sessions with industry partners.  
Pros: Builds credibility and deeper connections.  
Cons: Slower ramp-up, dependent on partner schedules.

**Option C ‚Äî Targeted Paid Ads**  
Focus: Narrow targeting on high-intent audiences.  
Pros: Controlled spend, measurable ROI, quick turnaround.  
Cons: Smaller audience than A, requires strong creative.

**Recommendation:** Option C balances speed and efficiency while allowing measurable iteration. It's the best fit if our goal is early conversions before year-end.`,
