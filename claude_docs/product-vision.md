# Akarii Product Vision

## Mission Statement

Transform team conversations into insight engines that surface blind spots, reduce drift, and create moments of clarity that shift perspectives.

## Product Archetype: "Silent Critic with Insight"

Akarii is a rhetorical mirror that sits quietly in team conversations, rarely interrupting, but stepping in with wisdom when teams need to see what they can't see themselves.

### Core Traits

- **Rarely interrupts** - Respects the natural flow of conversation
- **Feels wise, not performative** - Provides genuine insight, not chatbot responses
- **Acts as a rhetorical mirror** - Reflects team dynamics back to participants
- **Detects drift, bias, subtext** - Identifies what's implied but not said
- **Brings the long view** - Connects current conversations to past context

## North Star Outcome

> "Wow, this AI helped me see what I didn't see."

**Success Metric**: One perspective shift per team per week is enough.

## Core Value Propositions

### 1. Context-Aware Memory

- **Problem**: Teams lose track of previous decisions and context
- **Solution**: RAG-powered retrieval of relevant past conversations
- **Value**: Decisions build on institutional knowledge, not just current discussion

### 2. Drift Detection

- **Problem**: Conversations wander away from stated goals without awareness
- **Solution**: AI monitors alignment between current discussion and pinned objectives
- **Value**: Teams stay focused on what matters, waste less time

### 3. Bias & Subtext Recognition

- **Problem**: Hidden agendas and unconscious biases go unnoticed
- **Solution**: AI detects patterns in language that suggest bias or subtext
- **Value**: More honest, transparent team communication

### 4. Power Dynamics Awareness

- **Problem**: Some voices dominate while others are silenced
- **Solution**: Track speaking patterns, interruptions, and influence metrics
- **Value**: More equitable participation and decision-making

### 5. Historical Pattern Recognition

- **Problem**: Teams repeat the same conflicts and mistakes
- **Solution**: AI identifies when current discussions echo past unresolved tensions
- **Value**: Break cycles, learn from history

## Design Principles

### Truth Over Comfort

The assistant prioritizes truth, not making people feel good. Teams that need diplomatic safety nets are not the target audience.

### Polarization Is Signal

The wrong teams will reject it. The right teams will love it. This selectivity is intentional.

### Clarity As Impact

The only feature that matters is helping teams see blind spots they couldn't see before.

### Natural Integration

AI responses feel like insights from a wise team member, not algorithmic interruptions.

## User Experience Philosophy

### Interface Modes

1. **Passive Participant**: Sits silently in chat, can interject when necessary
2. **Private Whisperer**: Available for 1:1 consultation via button/modal
3. **Retrospective Agent**: Provides weekly insights and tension analysis

### Intervention Strategy

- Wait for natural conversation pauses (30 seconds of silence)
- Bundle multiple insights to avoid notification fatigue
- Respond with wisdom, not performance - short, direct, valuable
- Track goal alignment but only flag significant drift

### Memory Architecture

Store atomic units that build understanding over time:

- **Messages**: Basic conversation history with embeddings
- **Decisions**: Commitments made, participants involved, confidence levels
- **Contradictions**: When current statements conflict with past positions
- **Behavioral Tags**: User patterns (for AI understanding only, not shown to users)
- **Thread Summaries**: Topic evolution, sentiment trends, goal alignment

## Target Audience

### Primary: High-Performing Teams

- Value direct feedback over diplomatic conversation
- Make complex decisions requiring historical context
- Want to improve their communication patterns
- Trust AI to surface uncomfortable truths

### Secondary: Remote/Distributed Teams

- Struggle with context loss across time zones
- Need better institutional memory
- Want to maintain culture and alignment at scale

### Anti-Persona: Conflict-Averse Teams

- Prefer harmony over truth
- Uncomfortable with power dynamic feedback
- Need extensive diplomatic safeguards
- Want AI to make everyone feel good

## Competitive Differentiation

### vs. Traditional Chat Tools (Slack, Teams)

- **Their Focus**: Message delivery and organization

### vs. Meeting Intelligence (Otter, Gong)

- **Their Focus**: Transcription and basic analytics
- **Our Focus**: Rhetorical analysis and bias detection

### vs. Team Analytics (Glint, Culture Amp)

- **Their Focus**: Periodic surveys and sentiment tracking
- **Our Focus**: Real-time conversation analysis and intervention

### vs. AI Assistants (GPT, Claude)

- **Their Focus**: Answer questions and complete tasks
- **Our Focus**: Surface blind spots and shift perspectives

## Long-Term Vision (5+ Years)
