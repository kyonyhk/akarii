  <Narrative>
    <WhyNow>
      AI is here, but most teams aren’t ready. Their tools are outdated, disconnected, and can’t keep up with how work is changing.
    </WhyNow>
    <Problem>
      Context gets lost. Discussions drift. Decisions aren’t remembered.
      AI, when used, often feels bolted-on instead of woven into the workflow.
    </Problem>
    <Solution>
      <Summary>
        Start with a multiplayer workspace that’s fast enough for real-time collaboration, smart enough to track goals, decisions, and action items, and designed to become more intelligent over time.
