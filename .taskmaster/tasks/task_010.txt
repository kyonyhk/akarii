# Task ID: 10
# Title: MVP Testing, Validation and Production Deployment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Conduct comprehensive testing, implement cleanup mechanisms, and deploy for 3-user pilot testing
# Details:
Implement cleanup cron job for messages >30 days old. Add comprehensive error handling and edge cases (empty messages, long texts, API failures). Set up production environment with proper environment variables. Deploy to Vercel/Convex production. Conduct 3-user pilot testing with feedback collection forms. Monitor performance metrics: 100% reliability for 1000+ messages, p95 latency ≤ 1.5s. Validate ≥2/3 users report retrieval feels 'on point'.

# Test Strategy:
Run load testing with 1000+ messages, measure p95 latency under load, collect pilot user feedback on retrieval quality, verify cleanup cron works properly, and validate all success criteria are met

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement cleanup cron job for message retention [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create automated job to delete messages older than 30 days
### Details:
Set up Convex cron job to run daily and delete messages with ts older than 30 days. Implement batch deletion to handle large datasets efficiently. Add logging for cleanup operations and ensure proper error handling.

## 2. Add comprehensive error handling for edge cases [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement robust error handling for empty messages, long texts, and API failures
### Details:
Add validation for empty messages, implement text length limits, handle OpenAI API failures gracefully, add retry mechanisms for transient failures, and create fallback strategies for critical operations.

## 3. Configure production environment setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Set up production environment variables and configurations
### Details:
Configure production environment variables for Clerk, Convex, and OpenAI. Set up proper security configurations, configure CORS settings, and ensure all secrets are properly managed in production.

## 4. Deploy application to production platforms [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Deploy frontend to Vercel and backend to Convex production
### Details:
Deploy Next.js frontend to Vercel with production build optimizations. Deploy Convex functions to production environment. Configure domain settings and ensure proper routing between frontend and backend.

## 5. Execute load testing with performance validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Run comprehensive load tests and measure performance metrics
### Details:
Create test scenarios for 1000+ messages, measure p95 latency under load conditions, test concurrent user scenarios, validate system reliability, and document performance benchmarks.

## 6. Coordinate pilot user testing program [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.5
### Description: Set up and execute 3-user pilot testing with feedback collection
### Details:
Recruit 3 pilot users, create feedback collection forms, provide user onboarding materials, monitor user sessions, collect qualitative feedback on retrieval quality, and document user experience insights.

## 7. Validate success metrics and criteria [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.6
### Description: Verify all MVP success criteria are met and document results
### Details:
Validate 100% reliability metric for 1000+ messages, confirm p95 latency ≤ 1.5s requirement, verify ≥2/3 users report retrieval feels 'on point', document all metrics, and prepare final MVP validation report.
